# 3D Amusement Park Game


## Project Overview

Welcome to the world of 3D modeling! This project involves creating a 3D amusement park game where players navigate a lively and immersive amusement park environment. The objective is to design a fun and interactive game where players can achieve goals such as collecting items or reaching specific destinations within the park.

## Game Features

### Environment
- **Amusement Park Scene**: Includes the ground, boundary walls, and a variety of objects typical of an amusement park.
- **Objects**: The scene features at least nine different types of objects, including:
  - Three boundary walls
  - A ground plane
  - A player character
  - One or more goals/collectibles
  - Five additional objects such as trees, lamp posts, cars, kiosks, roller coasters, swings, seesaws, water fountains, gardens, benches, trash bins, and an information desk.

### Modeling
- **Player Character**: Modeled as a human with at least six primitives.
- **Boundary Walls**: Three sides, each with at least two primitives.
- **Ground**: Created using at least one primitive.
- **Major Objects**: Two major objects with at least five primitives each.
- **Minor Objects**: Three objects with at least three primitives each.
- **Goal/Collectible**: Can be one or more objects with at least three primitives each.
- **Realism**: Models should be as realistic as possible and must be colored.

### Collisions
- The player can move freely within the scene but cannot pass through the boundary walls.
- Goals/collectibles disappear upon collision and can be located either in fixed or random positions.

### Camera
- **Camera Movement**: Freely move the camera along all three axes.
- **Views**: Provide three different camera views:
  - Top View
  - Side View
  - Front View

### Animations and Controls
- **Player Movement**: Move in any direction using the keyboard and rotate towards the direction of motion using the mouse or keyboard.
- **Object Animations**: Each scene object (five) should have animations triggered by key presses (translation, rotation, or scaling).
- **Goal Animation**: The goal object(s) animate in place throughout the game.
- **Wall Colors**: Colors of the bounding walls change at regular intervals.
- **Camera Controls**: Change camera views using specified keyboard keys and move the camera using either the mouse or keyboard.

### Game End
- The game concludes when the time runs out. A ‘GAME WIN’ screen appears if the player collects the goal(s) within the allotted time; otherwise, a ‘GAME LOSE’ screen is shown.


## Bonus Features
Choose one of the following for bonus points:
1. **Complex 3D Models**: Create three detailed models with at least 10 primitives each.
2. **Sound Effects**: Implement three different sounds (background music, sound effects for animations, collisions).
